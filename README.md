### Module Responsibilities

| Module | Purpose | Key Functions |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Core Graph** | Basic data structure | `addVertex()`, `addEdge()`, `hasEdge()` |
| **Connectivity** | Graph analysis | `isConnected()`, `getAllVertices()` |
| **Spanning Tree** | Tree algorithms | `computeSpanningTree()`, `computeSpanningForest()` |
| **Hamiltonian** | Cycle algorithms | `findExactHamiltonianCycle()`, `findApproximateHamiltonianCycle()` |
| **TSP Boost** | Optimization | `computeMSTKruskal()`, `computeMSTPrim()` |

## Usage Examples

### Basic Graph Operations
```cpp
#include "graph.h"
#include "graph_connectivity.h"

// Create and populate a graph
UnidirectionalGraph graph;
graph.addEdge(0, 1);
graph.addEdge(1, 2);
graph.addEdge(2, 0);

// Check connectivity
bool connected = GraphConnectivity::isConnected(graph);
std::vector<int> vertices = GraphConnectivity::getAllVertices(graph);
```

### Spanning Tree Computation
```cpp
#include "spanning_tree.h"

// Compute spanning tree for connected graph
UnidirectionalGraph tree = SpanningTree::computeSpanningTree(graph);

// Compute spanning forest for any graph
UnidirectionalGraph forest = SpanningTree::computeSpanningForest(graph);
```

### Hamiltonian Cycle Finding
```cpp
#include "hamiltonian.h"

// Exact solution (good for small graphs)
std::vector<int> exact_cycle = Hamiltonian::findExactHamiltonianCycle(graph);

// Fast approximation (good for larger graphs)
std::vector<int> approx_cycle = Hamiltonian::findApproximateHamiltonianCycle(graph);
```

### Advanced TSP and MST Algorithms
```cpp
#include "tsp_boost.h"

// Minimum spanning trees
UnidirectionalGraph mst_kruskal = TSPBoost::computeMSTKruskal(graph);
UnidirectionalGraph mst_prim = TSPBoost::computeMSTPrim(graph);

// TSP with custom weights
std::vector<std::vector<double>> weights = {{0, 1, 2}, {1, 0, 1}, {2, 1, 0}};
std::vector<int> tsp_tour = TSPBoost::findApproximateHamiltonianCycle(graph, weights);
```

## Performance Characteristics

| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Best Use Case |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| **Connectivity Check** | O(V + E) | All graph sizes |
